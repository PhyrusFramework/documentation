# Back-End directories

Inside your project, there's the **/back-end** directory. This folder contains your back-end project written in PHP. Inside this directory you can actually create other directories with specific usages:

| Directory             | Use                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /back-end/code        | All PHP files in here will be **automatically loaded.** So you forget about imports. |
| /back-end/routes      | Automatically added routes                                                           |
| /back-end/middlewares | Automatically added middlewares                                                      |
