description: Launch a local server

# CLI Serve

Normally it is preferable to have a tool like Xampp, Mamp or Ampps to run a local server with apache and Mysql database.&#x20;

But, if you just need to run a fast test, you can start a local server directly on your project's folder with:

```
php cli serve
```
