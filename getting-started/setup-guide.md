description: Start a new project with Phyrus

# Setup guide

To start a new Phyrus project with Composer, just run this line in your terminal:

```
composer create-project phyrus/project MyProjectName
```

A new folder will be created with your project. Now:

* To run your website use a web server (e.g Apache or Nginx) on the /public directory.
* To develop your front-end use NPM and Nuxt in the /front-end directory. Read this documentation later to learn how to compile your front-end.
